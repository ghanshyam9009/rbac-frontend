Features and Layout
Sidebar
Logo Section: Displays a logo at the top of the sidebar.
Company Information: Contains information about the company such as the company name, address, and contact info.
Navigation Items:
Logout Button: Styled in red with a hover effect.
Help & Support Button: Styled in blue with a hover effect.
The sidebar is fixed on the left side and does not scroll with the content.
User Cards
Active Users: Displayed with a light green background.
Inactive Users: Displayed with a light red background.
Cards Layout: The user cards are displayed in a flex container, allowing them to wrap when the screen size is smaller.
Responsiveness
The design adapts to various screen sizes:

Mobile (up to 576px): The sidebar becomes a full-width header, and the user cards adjust to take up the full width of the screen.
Tablet (577px to 768px): The sidebar shrinks to 200px, and the content adjusts accordingly.
Desktop (769px and above): The sidebar is 250px wide, and the user cards remain at a fixed size.
Smooth Hover Effects
Sidebar items and buttons have smooth hover effects with transitions to change background color and text color.
